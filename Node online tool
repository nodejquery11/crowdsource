Note:
1. Each time, that you want to commit a bug or a feature, you need to create a branch for it, which will be a copy of your master branch.
2.When you do a pull request on a branch, you can continue to work on another branch and make another pull request on this other branch.
3.Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date
4.When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch.


Commands:-
1.You can see all branches created by using :
$ git branch

>approval_messages
>master
>master_clean

1. Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

2. Push the branch on github :
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]

3. Add a new remote for your branch : 
$ git remote add [name_of_your_remote]

4.Push changes from your commit into your branch :
$ git push [name_of_your_new_remote] [name_of_your_branch]

5. Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated : 
$ git fetch [name_of_your_remote]

6. Then you need to apply to merge changes, if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do :
$ git merge [name_of_your_remote]/develop

7. Delete a branch on your local filesystem :
$ git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]
